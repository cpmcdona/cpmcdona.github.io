I am an Assistant Professor of Environmental Engineering in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.mtu.edu/cee) at [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu). My focus area is water quality in natural systems, and I work at the intersection of limnology, biogeochemistry, and watershed science. My current research is focused on understanding how temporal and spatial variability in phosphorus and nitrogen transport at the landscape scale affect ecosystem function within individual water bodies, modeling ecosystem metabolism in aquatic systems, quantification of ecological processes in polymictic lakes, and ecological engineering for water quality management. My past research has focused on carbon biogeochemistry in lakes, the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle, and the fate and transport of heavy metals in aquatic sediments. I teach in the areas of water quality engineering and water quality modeling.
